<h1>Goals</h1>
	<ul>
	<li>Be the best person I can possibly be and treat others the way <strong>I would like to be treated</strong>.</li>
	<li>Become a self sufficient design in web and graphic design</li>
	<li>Be the person who makes it easier for individuals to <strong>naviagate through digital aspects </strong>and therefore make things a bit easier to navigate through their day.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Personally, I feel that the best impression is a first impression.  More often than not I <i>try to always put my best foot forward so that I am thought of someone that is friendly</i>, easy to approach and want to make an impact on the world.  My family is the most important thing to me and communication is key.</p>
